Prevent all secondary effects that would trigger on the User and Allies by guarded moves. Applies only to the instigating move. Z-Moves resolve normally, only taking into account the damage reduction of Z - Royal Decree. The instigating attack becomes a Physical and loses the Ranged move effect if applicable. (Becomes resisted by User and Allies Defense, and makes contact with the whole party.) Raise the User's Accuracy by 1 stage. Sets up Stealth Rocks on the opponent's battlefield, which triggers every time a victim switches targets from the one they had on the previous turn. When triggered, they deal 2d6 dice of damage. Add or subtract 1d6 for every weakness or resistance the victim has to Rock type, respectively.",
