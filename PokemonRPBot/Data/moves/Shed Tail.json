The decoy has the same defenses as the User, and all attacks targeting the Ally are automatically redirected to the decoy (Including All Foes and Area moves). If the decoy is attacked the Ally may Dodge to negate the attack as if they were the target. The decoy is unaffected by Support moves, Status conditions, Weather, and Stat Changes.",
