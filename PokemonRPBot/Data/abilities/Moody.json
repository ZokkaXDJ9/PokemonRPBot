  "description": "The Pokemon will have some severe mood swings, and be temperamental most of the time. Hopefully it's just a phase.",
  "effect": "At the start of each round, reduce a random stat by 1 and increase two other random stats by 1. Increases and decreases due to this ability can stack. Use `/moody` to automate this (these are Stat Changes subject to the standard +/-3 limit)."
