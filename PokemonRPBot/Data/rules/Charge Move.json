Start by calling the move and rolling accuracy to see if it hits\n- If you fail, your turn is skipped as normal; if you succeed, you must wait until the next turn\n- At the start of the next round, use the same initiative result as the prior round\n- You cannot stall during the charge of a Charge Move and take priority over anyone who rolls the same number\n- Once your turn comes up, roll the damage as normal and that turn is finished",
