If it would boost multiple stats, you get to choose one which will receive the crit bonus.\n- Defense cannot go below 0, combat stats can't go below 1.\n- A Pok√©mon can only be influenced by a buff/debuff once per source. This includes the move AND the source.\n- Buffs/debuffs to hit rate add +1/-1 to the hit rolls total value. You do not roll additional hit dice.",
